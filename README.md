**Project name:**  
SQL Second-Hand Car Dealership

**Project Description:**  
This repository contains the SQL project for a second-hand car dealership. The project aims to design and implement a simple relational database system to manage 
the inventory of a car dealership.


**Project Overview:**  
 1) Read the data. Display the tables
 2) Describe the tables
 3) Get the count of total records of cars
 4) What are the records with limited information (NULL values present)? => Potential to improve data quality
 5) Investigate the distinct values in each field 
 6) Data cleaning: Adjust the values in the transmission column
 7) Data cleaning: convert currency
 8) Rename the column mileage to consumption 
 9) Check how many cars are available in 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 in total and per year
 10) Check how many diesel and petrol cars are there from year 2020
 11) Check how many cars per year are there with respect to the fuel
 12) Select the years for which there are more than 200 cars available
 13) Select the car count for cars beween 2015 and 2023 and order the records by year
 14) Select the detailed car overview for cars beween 2015 and 2023
 15) Select the detailed car overview from year 2020, petrol as fuel, automatic transmission, minimum 4 seats and first owner only
 16) For each year, display the minimum, average and maximum selling price of each car having less than 100000 km driven
 17) Add and populate the field 'brand' in the cars table
 18) Elaborate how much kg or liters of fuel is needed per driven kilometer and calculate the price per driven km
 19) The customer requests the TOP 10 cars ordered by operating costs (price per km), which have at most 100000 km driven and the models aren't older than 2020
 20) A family on budget is interested in a car with 7+ seats, automatic transmission and low aquisition price for their road trips. What are the TOP 10 dealer proposals?
